    <p>游꾿&nbsp; The exact origin of mango sticky rice in Thailand it is believed to date back to the late Ayutthaya period. A verse from that era describes a fondness for sweet dishes, including a mention of Ok Rong Mango, which is a cultivar native to Thailand.[14</p>
    <p>游꾿&nbsp; Mango sticky rice is a common street food in Thailand and is considered an attractive factor by foreigner tourists for travelling in Thailand.[18]</p>
    <p>游꾿&nbsp; Usually desserts involving sticky rice are sweetened with palm sugar or jaggery combined with coconut milk and coconut flakes, wrapped in banana leaf, then steamed or stuffed in bamboo and roasted on an open fire such as sticky rice in bamboo.[3] The main ingredients needed are sticky rice (glutinous rice), canned or fresh coconut milk, salt, palm sugar and mangoes.</p>
    <p>游꾿&nbsp; It is prepared by soaking sticky rice in room temperature water for at least one hour, then washing, draining and steaming the rice for 20 minutes. Once the rice has almost cooked, a mixture of coconut milk, sugar and salt is gradually mixed into the rice before cooking the mixture at low heat for another 5 to 10 minutes. It is served with freshly squeezed coconut milk on top and bite-sized cubes of peeled mango on the side.[20]</p>
    <p>游꾿&nbsp; To prepare the dish, the rice is soaked in water and then cooked by steaming or the use of a rice cooker. Meanwhile, the coconut milk is mixed with salt and sugar then heated without boiling. After the rice is finished cooking, the coconut milk mixture and the rice are mixed together evenly and allowed to sit to allow the milk to absorb into the rice. The mangoes are peeled and sliced. To serve the dish, the rice is scooped onto a plate, a few mango slices are placed on top or to the side, and the remaining coconut milk is drizzled on top. Sometimes, the sticky rice is topped with crispy yellow mung beans.[4]</p>
    <p>游꾿&nbsp; As of 2013, approximately 6,530 glutinous rice varieties were collected from five continents (Asia, South America, North America, Europe, and Africa) where glutinous rice is grown for preservation at the International Rice Genebank (IRGC).[6] The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has described Laos as a "collector's paradise".[7] Laos has the largest biodiversity of sticky rice in the world. IRRI-trained collectors gathered more than 13,500 samples and 3,200 varieties from Laos alone.[7]</p>
    <p>游꾿&nbsp; Like all types of rice, glutinous rice does not contain dietary gluten (i.e. does not contain glutenin and gliadin) and should be safe for gluten-free diets.[9]</p>
