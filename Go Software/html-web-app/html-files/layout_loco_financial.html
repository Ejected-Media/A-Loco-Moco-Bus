		<li>GET YOUR HIGH-TECH INNOVATION FUNDED.
FOR WHAT'S NEXT.
America’s Seed Fund, powered by NSF invests up to $2 million in funding for startups that are developing technologies.</li>

<li>WHAT WE LOOK FOR
We help startups navigate the earliest stages of technology translation.
When determining which startups to fund, we look for the following:
Global
Impact:
Make a difference to people worldwide or revolutionize an industry.
Ideas
Technological Innovation:
You need research and development funding to create new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. NSF does not fund straightforward engineering or incremental product development tasks.
Expansion
Scale:
If you successfully bring your product or service to market, it could form the foundation for a scalable business and make a large impact in your target market.
Check
Market Pull:
You have evidence that your product or service could meet an important, unmet need for your customers.
AM I ELIGIBLE?
To be eligible for funding, your company must adhere to the following requirements:
Must be a small business (fewer than 500 employees) and located in the United States.
At least 50% of your company’s equity must be owned by U.S. citizens or permanent residents. NSF does not fund companies that are majority-owned by multiple venture capital firms, private equity firms, or hedge funds, to participate in SBIR and STTR.
All funded work, including work done by consultants and contractors, needs to take place in the United States.
The project’s principal investigator (tech lead) must be legally employed at least 20 hours a week by the company seeking funding. The PI doesn’t need any advanced degrees.
The principal investigator needs to commit to at least one month (173 hours) of work on a funded project per six months of project duration.</li>

		<li>We help your organization to successfully find and apply for the best funding opportunities
The unique Grantify platform is a powerful online tool that streamlines the application process and makes it simpler and more efficient to apply for grants. You’ll get detailed guidance and model answers, plus access to a dedicated support channel of experts.</li>

<li>Where do good projects fail?
We’ve talked to amazing businesses with incredible innovations, who have lost out on federal technology grants due to exam board “requirements”.

This happens because they’re experts on their projects, not professional writers or researchers. Without a proven and tested process, federal grant applications get rejected.

Traditional grant consultancies don’t guarantee funding for businesses or research and development, making you jump through hoops like:

– Wasting your time reading long, open-ended instructional PDFs
– Endless, vague suggestions for change
– Writing it all yourself from nothing

You can avoid all of this when you apply for grant money with Grantify.</li>

	<li>Building Local and Statewide Connections
Small businesses in Arizona can leverage local and statewide connections to tap into a wide array of resources. In cities like Phoenix, small business owners can engage with the Arizona Small Business Development Center (AZSBDC), which offers support to help launch and sustain businesses across the region. Additionally, statewide initiatives like ecivis, a grants management system, offer crucial support to small businesses seeking funding and partnership opportunities.</li>

<li>Overview of Arizona Funding Landscape
The State of Arizona offers a diverse range of funding options geared towards fostering the growth of small businesses. Entities such as the Arizona Commerce Authority actively engage in extending grants designed to bolster innovative, technology-driven enterprises. For example, they provide the Federal and State Technology (FAST) grant to support small business owners, boosting their competitive edge on a national scale.

Local initiatives, like Local First Arizona, contribute substantially to the expansion of statewide economic development through grant programs. They encourage entrepreneurs to seek funding opportunities that align with their specific needs, optimizing chances for successful business growth.

The Maricopa Grants program, another significant contributor, offers reimbursement-based financial support for losses incurred by small businesses, reflecting Maricopa County's commitment to sustaining the local business community.

Within the funding ecosystem, one can also observe a trend towards encouraging sustainable and innovative business operations. Thriving in the Future: 2024 Business Trends Shaping Arizona's Landscape outlines the dynamic evolution of the Arizona business topography, indicating a drive towards integrating sustainability and innovation into the mainstream business models.</li>

<li>Grant Programs for Small Businesses in Arizona
In Arizona, small businesses have several grant opportunities designed to support innovation, technology development, and economic growth. Both federal and state entities offer funding programs, while local grants aim to meet the unique needs of the community.

Federal and State Grant Opportunities
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs are federal funding mechanisms that small businesses engaged in research and development (R&D) can tap into. The Arizona Commerce Authority often facilitates access to these grants and provides resources to help businesses apply.

Local programs supported by the Arizona Commerce Authority include the Federal and State Technology (FAST) Grant. This grant aims to advance innovative, technology-driven small businesses with the potential for commercialization of their products or services.

Local Grants and Funding Options
The Arizona Community Foundation distributes various grants to support local small businesses, focusing on different sectors and needs within the state. Among the opportunities available, small businesses can find grants designed to foster job creation, support employee retention, and aid in hiring.

In cities like Phoenix, small business owners can seek Micro and Small Business Grants to assist with economic hardship or expansion efforts. Eligible businesses, particularly those in areas with lower median incomes or higher poverty rates, may receive additional support.</li>

	<li>Introduction
Are you wondering how to get government grants for your small business and not sure where to start? Securing capital can be one of the trickiest parts of any new business venture, reaching a grant can take some stress out of the equation. 

Whether or not you will qualify for free funding to support your company will depend on the nature of your business and a few other factors. Funding for small businesses and startup grants are typically given if the work you’re doing aligns with specific local needs in Arizona.

The Arizona Commerce Authority
The ACA is a helpful resource for Arizona residents who are starting a small business. You can check their website periodically for grant opportunities and competitions.

The AZ STEP Program
The Arizona Commerce Authority runs the Arizona’s State Trade Expansion Program (STEP). The STEP Grant offers some funding to small businesses expanding into the international market or exporting their products for the first time. The program is partially funded by a grant from the Small Business Organization (SBA).

It enables eligible businesses in the state to contribute to economic growth, job creation, and increase their revenue through international sales.

STEP Program Benefits
Financial assistance, capacity building, and tech help are just a few of the benefits you may gain from working with this program. Here are some of the specific tools and services that AZ STEP may help your small business with:

Export counseling for your business via webinars, seminars, or education and training workshops.
Help creating a strategy for your company to choose the right markets and enter those which are suitable for your service or product.
Assistance for your business in identifying distributors, potential buyers, agents, and strategic partners to work with.
Help with search engine optimization, translation, and website localization for your business regarding export markets.
Opportunities Through Grants.gov
The U.S. government runs Grants.gov to help small business owners find funding. The site has a searchable data base and information on grants available to businesses in a variety of industries.

Whether you are seeking an equipment grant for your small business or some other funding, you can register your organization and get started in your search.

Disability Small Business Grants
If you want to apply for small business grants as a disabled state resident, the Arizona Rehabilitation Services Administration is a good place to start.

AZRSA Assistance
The AZRSA provides vocational counseling, work experience, job placement assistance, and skills training. They might also be able to offer you help with your small business startup costs. To qualify, you must meet the program’s eligibility criteria and develop a business plan that the AZRSA approves.

Keep in mind that this only applies to startup costs and not ongoing expenses for your business. Financial assistance from the AZRSA may not cover all of your expenses and will not supply recurring or ongoing financial support.

While this service is not always available, you may be able to secure funding depending on the office you apply with, your business idea, and the Vocational Rehabilitation counselor you go through. You will want to get in touch with the AZRSA to learn more and find out whether you qualify.</li>

		<li>How do business grants work?
Provided by Government departments, corporations, foundations and other organizations, business grants can be used to support business opportunities, or initiatives in the arts, education, research and more. However, Arizona entrepreneurs seeking a business grant should expect a lengthy application process, typically needing to meet strict guidelines, timelines and other qualifying criteria. Competition for this type of funding is often fierce and even if you qualify, the award sum may be small requiring you to seek additional finance. 

Be aware that many business grants are tied to specific goals – entrepreneurial, educational, creative and motivational – and selection committees have full control of the award process and the sums distributed. To succeed, you will usually need a strong business plan that includes a feasibility study and an indication of how you intend to keep the venture going in the post-grant period. 

Lastly, if you receive an award, the money may come to you all at once, but more usually, it will come in stages – either based on a set calendar or on your venture achieving fixed objectives. Unlike business loans, grants do not need to be repaid, making them a critical financial resource for ventures that cannot sustain a large financial burden.
