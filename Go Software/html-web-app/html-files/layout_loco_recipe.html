 The origins of the dish is up for debate, but most can agree that it was invented in 1949 at either the Lincoln Grill restaurant, or Cafe 100, both in Hilo, Hawaii. The story goes that the dish was created for local teens that had come in for breakfast. They requested something unique from a typical sandwich and not as time consuming as asian food to prepare

 in my opinion, the best place to get this classic Hawaiian fusion dish is at the Rainbow Drive-In in Oahu. if that’s a bit out of reach, your kitchen could be a close runner-up (though my version may not be the most authentic)! it’s super easy to prepare this hearty Hawaiian favorite at home- just assemble your patties, smother with decadent homemade gravy, and top with the perfect sunny-side-up egg. this rich dish is a great, filling meal for any time of day</p>

 From the islands to your table, Loco Moco is Hawaiian comfort food made with rice and a burger smothered with rich gravy and a runny yolk</p>

 Loco moco is the Hawaiian favorite that’s as fun to say as it is to eat. Reportedly created as an alternative to a juicy burger on the island of Maui and served at all hours of the day, loco moco is a hearty, filling stack of fluffy steamed rice, savory brown gravy, seasoned beef patty, and sunny-side up egg.

 When you think of Hawaiian food, you might think of items found at a lu'au — roasted pork, fresh fish, and tropical fruits like pineapple and coconut. You might not think of a ground beef patty served with mushroom gravy and an egg. But that's exactly what this classic Hawaiian loco moco recipe entails
