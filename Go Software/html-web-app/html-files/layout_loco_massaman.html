    <p>🎈&nbsp; Khmer royal cuisine has evolved over the centuries with influences from India, China, Thailand, Vietnam and France.[2]</p>
    <p>🎈&nbsp; using highly developed techniques which had been displayed by the builders of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's most famous monument, in the distant past. By all accounts, such cooks produced dishes of visual appeal equal to or surpassing those of any other cuisine.</p>
    <p>🎈&nbsp; At the peak of Khmer Empire's power, its palace kitchens produced a sophisticated royal cuisine. After the Khmer Empire was defeated by Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1353 and 1430,[6] Khmer royal cooks were brought to Ayutthayan palace kitchens where they influenced the Thai royal cuisine.[7][8] Through Java, the preparation of curry pastes from South India had been adopted into Khmer royal cuisine that added lemongrass and galangal to the recipe, which then made its way into the royal kitchens of Ayuttaya, where turmeric was replaced with cardamom and tamarind.[9] Khmer royal dishes were further developed in the Ayutthaya Kingdom, where during the reign of King Narai they were supplemented with Portuguese recipes and brought back into the Khmer palace kitchens.[7]</p>
    <p>🎈&nbsp; The distinctions between the three culinary styles are not as pronounced as in the case of Thailand or Laos,[3] and the main characteristics that set Khmer royal cuisine apart from the other two culinary styles are the higher quality ingredients and more elaborate cooking techniques.[4][page needed] There has never been a special corpus of Khmer royal cuisine with specific codes, ingredients and decorum like in the case of Japanese yūsoku ryōri [jp] or Thai chaowang.[5]</p>
    <p>🎈&nbsp; In the 1800s, Khmer palaces had separate kitchens for preparing desserts and snack foods, and it was done by wives, concubines and female members of the inner court. The Khmer palace desserts were labour-intensive and included intricately carved fruits and vegetables, candied flowers, perfumed water, and jasmine flowers picked at sunset, steeped in water overnight, and used to flavor sugar and finished desserts. Miniature fruits and vegetables made out of soybean paste, palm sugar and coconut, and dipped in gelatin were also made in the Khmer palace kitchens and served at royal weddings.[10]</p>
    <p>🎈&nbsp; With the Columbian exchange, non-native crops—such as tomato, papaya, sweetcorn, pineapple and chili peppers—were introduced to Southeast Asia probably through the various sea ports of modern-day Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam via the Philippines[17] and Malacca. Through trades with the Portuguese and other Europeans, acceptance and cultivation of non-native crops and ingredients quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
    <p>🎈&nbsp; 
By the mid-1500s, the Europeans were already exploring and trading with mainland Southeast Asia reaching as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang, Laos. Some of the more notable Europeans who had travelled as far as Vientiane and Luang Prabang or wrote extensively about their experiences were Fernão Mendes Pinto (1542-1545),[18] Diogo Veloso and Blas Ruiz (1596), Geebard van Wusthof (1641),[19] Giovanni Filippo de Marini (1642-1648),[20] Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix (1830), and Henri Mouhot (1861).</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp; Simon de la Loubère (1642-1729) observed that the cultivation of the papaya was already widespread in Siam around the early-1700s[21] and by the time Jean-Baptiste Pallegoix (1830) arrived as missionary to Bangkok, the papaya and chili peppers was already fully integrated in the Lao territory, dependencies and the Southeast Asian food culture as a whole.[22][23][24][25][26]</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp; French explorer Henri Mouhot, during his trip to Luang Prabang, noted that the Laotians adored chili peppers.[27]</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp; The name massaman is a corruption of the term mosalman (Persian: مسلمان),[13] an archaic word derived from Persian, meaning "Muslim"[14] and the name massaman did not exist in Persian or Indian languages.[15] Hence, many earlier writers from the mid-19th century called the dish "Mussulman curry".[16] [17][18]</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp; According to Thai journalist and scholar Santi Sawetwimon, as well as Thai food experts David Thompson and Hanuman Aspler the dish originated in 17th century central Thailand at the cosmopolitan court of Ayutthaya,[19] through the Persian merchant Sheik Ahmad Qomi, from whom the noble Thai Bunnag family descends.[20][21] Most theories contend that massaman is a southern Thai dish influenced by Malay and Indian cuisine.[22]</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp;  The Muslim roots of the dish are evident in many of the flavors of the massaman curry paste (nam phrik kaeng matsaman) that come from spices not frequently used in other Thai curries. Cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, star anise, cumin, bay leaves, nutmeg and mace would, in the 17th century, have been brought to Thailand from the Malay Archipelago and South Asia by foreigners, a trade originally dominated by Muslim traders from the Middle East, Indian subcontinent, and from the archipelago itself, but increasingly undertaken by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the French East India Company.[8]</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp;  These foreign spices and flavors are then combined with local produce and flavors commonly used in native Thai cuisine such as dried chili peppers,[9] coriander seeds, lemongrass, galangal, white pepper, shrimp paste, shallots, and garlic to make the massaman curry paste.</p>
<p>🎈&nbsp;  The curry paste is first fried with coconut cream, and only then are meat, potatoes, onions, fish sauce or salt, tamarind paste, sugar, coconut milk and peanuts added.[10][11] Massaman is usually eaten with rice together in a meal with other dishes. There are also traditional versions using oranges, orange juice, or pineapple juice as additional ingredients.[12]</p>
